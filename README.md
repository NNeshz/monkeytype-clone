# Monkeytype Clone

This is a project based on the [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) website. It is a typing test website that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy.

## What I hope to learn

I hope to learn how to create a website using Flask and how to use websockets to create a real-time typing test.
